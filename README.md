# WindowsBackupMon
Easy way to view backup status on multiple windows server or desktops

The application lets you add servers/desktop by name, username, and password.  Passwords are stored using encryption in the registry.  It uses a treeview to show you the status and each first level node is a server and the text shows you the most recent log entry with date and time.  Expand it to show two weeks worth of logs.
